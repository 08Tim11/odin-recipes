        <h3>History:</h3>

        <p>
            <strong>Cheesecake</strong> is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest, layer consists of a mixture of a soft, fresh cheese (typically cottage cheese, cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it most often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.

        <p>
            An ancient form of <strong>cheesecake</strong> may have been a popular dish in ancient <em>Greece</em> even prior to Romans' adoption of it with the conquest of Greece.The earliest attested mention of a cheesecake is by the Greek physician Aegimus (5th century BCE), who wrote a book on the art of making cheesecakes.
