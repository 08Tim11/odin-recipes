    <h3>History:</h3>

    <p>
        <strong>Pizza</strong> is a dish of <em>Italian</em> origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small <strong>pizza</strong> is sometimes called a <strong>pizzetta</strong>.

Modern <strong>pizza</strong> evolved from similar flatbread dishes in <em>Naples, Italy</em>, in the 18th or early 19th century.Before that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims.Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries.
